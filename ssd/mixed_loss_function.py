"""
This is the YOLO loss formulation.
The first part of the function is not very pretty. The correct predictions are given as one big blob of data.
The exact content is described in the generator.py file.
In this function, we slice the individual components out of the blob.

The loss has multiple components.
The output of the network is [batch_size, out_x, out_y, anchor boxes, data]
This is reshaped to a vector of cells [batch_size, out_x * out_y, anchor boxes, data]
-> each cell contains a list of anchor boxes and the data belonging to each anchor box.
Then, for every anchor box, we take a closer look at the data.

There is one trick:
The loss function needs information about the network.
These are curried in.
See the demo on how this works.
