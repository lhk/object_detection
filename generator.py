"""
Keras is able to fit a model on a generator.
This allows you to:
 1. load batches dynamically - you don't have to keep your entire dataset in memory
 2. process/ prepare your data
 3. apply online augmentation
 
The following class does all of this. The constructor expects a path to the dataset.
A call to __next__(self) will:
 1. set up arrays to hold the data fed to the network
 2. loads data from the data_path
 3. augments the images and bounding boxes
 4. applies preprocessing
 5. fills the arrays to be fed to the network.
 
I'm trying to keep the parts well separated.
The data loading/augmentation is pretty much standard.
The filling of the arrays is complicated and prepares the YOLO loss formulation.
This is the interesting part of the code, you can compare with the loss function in loss.py

The class is an iterator.
Please note that I'm using only thread-local storage by allocating new variables for everything in the __next__ method.
The __next__ method is (hopefully) thread-safe.
This allows me to use the keras built-in support for multiple workers.
See the demo for training a model with this iterator.

The various arrays are all appended into one big blob of data.
That's not very nice. It's NOT a feature and NOT part of the loss.
It's a workaround to allow a loss function with the parameters (y_true, y_predicted).
Please note how the data is sliced into the blob at the end of the generator.
The loss function contains completely symmetrical code to slice the data out of the blob.
